Weather App (The Odin Project)
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses mainly on working with APIs and using the fetch method in JavaScript.
The app lets you search for cities and shows the current weather using the OpenWeatherMap API. It works as intended, though there are still a few things that could be improved later on.

What works:
Weather data is successfully fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
City searches and DOM updates are handled dynamically.
Uses asynchronous JavaScript with proper async/await logic and basic error handling.

Things to improve:
- In large cities, the API sometimes returns specific districts instead of the city itself.
- Some small bugs in the fetch request handling still need to be fixed.
- The UI is only temporary and will be redesigned in the future — right now the main focus was on making the API work correctly.
- A few improvements to error messages and validation are also planned.

The main goal was to understand how APIs work, how to fetch data from them, and how to display that data in the browser.
It wasn’t about creating a perfect UI, but about learning the workflow and logic behind asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

Even though there are still a few rough edges, the project does what it’s supposed to do.
It’s a solid first version that focuses on functionality first — and from here, everything else can be built and improved step by step.
